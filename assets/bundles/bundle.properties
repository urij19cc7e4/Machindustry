machindustry.title = Machindustry
machindustry.welcome-title = Machindustry mod tutorial
machindustry.welcome-text = This mod is focused on the quality of the game in PvP mode on the planet Erekir. On PC it is controlled with the mouse when the corresponding key is pressed. You can change the keys in the settings. On mobile device you have to press button to the left of the block table and then set area/path using touchscreen. These buttons are incompatible with other mods that are adding buttons to the game interface in this place (for example Scheme Size). The pictures below show the main use cases of the mod on PC. Additional information can be found on the mod's GitHub page.
